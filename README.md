This repository contains a project about disease classification using DenseNet in apple leaves. 
The objective is to asses the effectiveness of DenseNet in classifying disease based on segment of apple leaves.
The data is taken from Kaggle and we conduct the programming using Python in Google Colab with modified DenseNet169 architecture (taken from: Huang, “Densely Connected Convolutional Networks”, CVPR, 2017 [Online]. Available: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf).
